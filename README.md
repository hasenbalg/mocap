# Leap Motion "GSEI"
Leap Motion gesture steering for equirectangular images
## Cubemap instead of sphere for image mapping
This should reduce performance issues with slower hardware
## _Brightness with pinch after Hand rotated around -90°/+90° for HDR images_
A little addition, might make it in to the final build or not
